!speak !s   — <text> joins author's VC and speak text input via google TTS 

!counter    — display a simple interactive button

#todo

!move !mv   — <@mentions> move mentioned members to author's current VC

!deaf !df   — mute everyone in VC except from the author

!daily      — start an automated daily meeting
